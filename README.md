The whole thing is currently in french but I can make a translated version if asked.

I recommend playing Doki Doki before playing this fan game. You can download DDLC [here](https://ddlc.moe)

As the description says, I made this for a school project. I already presented it to my teacher and classmates, it went really well and was really gratifying to show my work to people. That's why I decided to add it on GitHub and post it on the net. 

Btw my teacher gave me 43,5/60 for this... I lost a lot of points because it was a group work, but my classmate didn't do anything. I ended up not talking about him in the "Behind the scenes" section and that got me in trouble, there were 15 points for team job, and we got 0. Oops.

Edit: I made quite a lot of changes since I first uploaded this repository. I think I have at least 50 commits on this. That's because I've been testing stuff on the live version, a lot of stuff broke, but I ended up fixing them and adding cool stuff like the ability to play on phone (it was litteraly impossible before).
